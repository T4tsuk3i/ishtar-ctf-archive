3,Welcome Guardian,"The Golden Age was a time of unparalleled advancement. Human civilization expanded beyond Earth, guided by scientific discovery and the silent watch of distant observation facilities.

One such facility was AROHAL SYLORIN.

Constructed by the Ishtar Collective, AROHAL SYLORIN operated as a deep-space archival and monitoring station. Its purpose was simple in design, but vast in scope: to observe, preserve, and safeguard knowledge across time and space. Within its sealed archive nodes rested fragments of human understanding — research, signals, and records never meant to be lost.

When the Collapse came, AROHAL SYLORIN went silent.

Now, fragments of its archive have begun transmitting once more.

Initial inspection suggests the container is empty, yet internal indexing logs reference additional entries that do not appear through standard listing methods.

When archives become fragmented, automated recovery systems often produce excessive metadata. Most of it is irrelevant. Only specific entries retain archival significance.

6,Ishtar Archive 1,"two flags in hereeee.... 

Ishtar Collective recovery teams intercepted a fragmented diagnostic archive originating from the AROHAL SYLORIN observation node.

Preliminary analysis indicates that portions of the archive remain readable, though not through conventional viewing interfaces. Recovery specialists typically relied on low-level extraction utilities capable of isolating human-readable strings from otherwise opaque archive containers. These tools allowed technicians to filter recovered text and identify valid archive designations hidden within diagnostic noise.

However, Ishtar archival protocols also permitted the embedding of visual records directly within transport logs. These embedded artifacts were not visible through standard inspection and required dedicated structural analysis tools capable of identifying and extracting embedded file signatures from larger archive containers.

Modern recovery environments still support these reconstruction utilities. Tools such as `strings`, combined with filtering mechanisms like `grep`, can reveal readable archive markers. For deeper structural inspection and extraction of embedded visual records, Ishtar recovery teams relied on signature analysis utilities such as `binwalk`, which can identify and recover embedded file structures.

Before there was a Witness, there was a civilization.
They were once like us — struggling, hoping, prospering under a god that gave them gifts but never spoke. And in that silence, they began to crave something more. They found the Veil. They studied the Darkness. They saw the Light not as salvation but as chaos unbound.
And so they chose to end the chaos. To merge themselves into the answer they had always wanted.
Ahsa's testimony records their ultimate ambition — not as metaphor, but as doctrine. A single phrase. The state they sought to impose on all of existence.

Xita called them virtuous — Ur, Yul, Xol, Akka, Eir. She said: ""Look upon us and know that We are go[o]d."" But look at what they wrought. Hunger that imprisoned. Honesty that conquered. Thousands that whispered madness. Secrets that enslaved. Order that served a Witness that cared nothing for any of them.
The Krill became the Hive. The worms became servants. Rhulk became a Disciple. And somewhere beneath all of it — beneath the trades, the servitude, the nurturing — a truth was buried that the Subjugator never wanted spoken aloud.
In the Deep, my children pay a price in servitude, for survival. In ascendance, the Hive pay a price in servitude, for power. And in the dark, I pay a price in servitude, so that others may be nurtured.
This system holds two final truths.
The first lives in the nature of the worms themselves. You have walked through their domains — hunger, honesty, thousands, secrets. Eir is the last. Its domain is hidden somewhere in this machine. Find it. Then ask yourself what all five domains have in common. What were they, truly? Assemble the answer in order, from first to last, and you will have what you seek.
The second requires you to prove yourself worthy of the conclusion. Somewhere in this machine a judgment waits. Find it. Host it. Download it. Face what it throws at you. Five phases. Five domains. Survive them all and the final truth — the one Rhulk could never admit — will be spoken aloud at last.
It must not be in vain.

30,AROHAL SYLORIN — The Lost Node,"**Why are we here????**

""227 Ishtars in a Vex.""
During the Golden Age, the Ishtar Collective captured a Vex unit for study. What they discovered changed everything — the Vex had been simulating the entire research team with such perfection that the odds of being the real version of yourself collapsed to near zero. Rasputin pulled them out. The simulated copies volunteered to go back in — to study the Vex from the inside for as long as it took.
AROHAL SYLORIN was built to listen to them.
A classified deep archive node on Venus, off the books, outside the Academy's official records. It received transmissions from the copies inside the Vex network for decades — data on chronological mechanics, paracausal phenomena, the nature of the Final Shape itself. The AUGURMIND was built partly on what AROHAL SYLORIN learned.
When the Collapse came, the node went dark. The Ishtar Collective assumed it destroyed. The Vanguard never knew it existed. Rasputin's records of it were purged by the Malahayati submind when Chioma Esi sent Stargazer to scrub Neptune from his memory.
It was not destroyed.
You have found it. The archive is fragmented across six recovery protocols, each one locked behind a different layer of security that the Ishtar researchers built to protect what they had learned from the wrong hands.
The wrong hands have always found it in the end.
Six flags. Six layers. One truth about what the copies inside the Vex network discovered before the Collapse silenced them forever. The AUGURMIND predicted the end. Soteria tried to warn us. AROHAL SYLORIN recorded it all.
Not all records are intended for conventional viewing environments.
